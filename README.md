# TypingTutor

*Requirement*

+Build a GUI application that can help users learn to “touch type” (i.e. type correctly without looking at the keyboard). <br />
+The application should display a virtual keyboard and should allow the user to watch what he or she is typing on the screen without looking at the actual keyboard. <br />
+Use JButtons to represent the keys. <br />
+As the user presses each key, the application highlights the corresponding JButton on the GUI and adds the character to a JTextArea that shows what the user has typed so far. <br />
